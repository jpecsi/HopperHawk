### Overview
HopperHawk is an ESPHome-based smart monitoring device designed for pellet smoker enthusiasts. Using a TOF10120 time-of-flight sensor, it continuously measures the pellet level in your smoker's hopper and reports real-time fill status directly to Home Assistant. This integration enables automated low-fuel notifications, ensuring your long smoking sessions never run out of pellets unexpectedly. The device features an 18650 LiPo battery with approximately 24 hours of operational battery life, making it a reliable, wireless solution for both overnight and extended smoking sessions. HopperHawk bridges the gap between traditional smoking and smart home automation, providing peace of mind for your low-and-slow cooking adventures.
